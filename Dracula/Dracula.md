# **A review of Dracula**

Bram Stokerâ€™s Dracula is a timeless masterpiece set in the late Nineteenth century which is sure to send chills down your spine even centuries later with its elements of classic Gothic horror and detailed set-pieces rooted in the centuries old folktales of Romania. Blending the characteristics of real-life figures such as Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Vlad Dracula in his days as the Prince of Wallachia, Sir Henry Irving and Jacques Damala presented us with the character known as Count Dracula, or simply Dracula as most have taken to calling him. The Count holds an irreplaceable prestige in the ever-expanding roster of characters rooted in the essence of classical horror.

You might recognize several clichÃ© tropes and methods of world-building as well as inducing a creepy chill in the minds of the readers. This legendary book is the inventor of many such tropes, Sir Bram Stoker pioneered the genre of horror with this work of fiction, his detailing and story-boarding skills still stand heads and shoulders above many of his contemporaries even to this very day.

The story is not without its faults. Nevertheless, Johnathan Harkerâ€™s stay at Castle Dracula felt nothing short of bone chilling, the Countâ€™s eerie politeness and strange mannerisms incited a feeling of panic with the unnerving absence of mirrors and the creeping sense of being trapped. Stoker nails the atmosphere and the first half of the book is a masterclass in traditional horror writing.

But once the story shifts to England, the pacing becomes inconsistent, the tension dips and some sections (most notably, the ship logs) are a drag to push through. The scarcity of action scenes for such a physically driven book feels like a let-down at some points. The characters are a mixed bag- Mina Harker is smart and resourceful, opposing traditional misogynistic stereotypes of the Victorian era. But other characters such as Lucy fall prey to irrelevancy. Van Helsing is fascinating, though his broken English, while an interesting character trait to define his Dutch heritage, is distracting and makes his speeches less impactful. He comes off as condescending as opposed to wise and his questionable competence takes away from his aura of mystique and stability.

The character of Dracula himself was nailed to perfection, he was as iconic as they come but strangely absent for sizeable chunks of the text. When he's on the page, he's mesmerizing and commands attention, instilling fear like no other. But his absence is very noticeable when he's not. The finale felt somewhat rushed and anticlimactic after a very strong and thorough buildup in the final sections of the book.

Still, the books strengths far outweigh its flaws. The eerie suspense, fascinating use of journals and letters, plot devices such as foreshadowing which were very nuanced in the era of its creation and the sheer pedigree and gravitas of it all makes the book worth reading.
